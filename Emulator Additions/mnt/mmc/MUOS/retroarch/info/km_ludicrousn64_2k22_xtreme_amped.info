description = "LudicrousN64 Xtreme is a heavily modified version of the Mupen64Plus-Next core maintained by KMFDManic. It features aggressive performance tuning and custom enhancements known as 'Xtreme Additions' including Turbo Boost Mode and Xtreme OverClock. These features trade stability for speed, often resulting in visual glitches, crashes, or desyncs. Intended for advanced users and modders, this core pushes the boundaries of N64 emulation with features like unsynchronized audio/video for maximal performance. Not recommended for general use. Cheats are disabled in this core. Uses GLideN64 for video and RSP-HLE for audio."
